                        <p>
                            My website address is:

                        <h3>Comments</h3>
                        <p>When visitors leave comments on the site, I collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP
                            address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
                        <p>
                            An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to
                            see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:

                            . After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in your comment.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Media</h3>
                        <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS)
                            included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>
                        <h3>Cookies</h3>
                        <p>If you leave a comment on the site, you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These
                            are so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last
                            for one year.</p>
                        <p>If you visit our login page, I will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie
                            contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
                        <p>When you log in, I will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices.
                            Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select &#8220;Remember
                            Me&#8221;, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no
                            personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
                        <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
                        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other
                            websites behaves in the same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
                        <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your
                            interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an
                            account and are logged in to that website.</p>
                        <h3>Who I share your data with</h3>
                        <p>If you request a password reset, it will include your IP address in the reset email.</p>
                        <h3>How long I keep your data</h3>
                        <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so I can recognize and
                            approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
                        <p>For users that register on our website (if any), I also store the personal information they provide in their user
                            profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information (except they cannot change their username).
                            Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
                        <h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
                        <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the
                            personal data I hold about you, including any data you have provided to me. You can also request that I erase any
                            personal data I hold about you. This does not include any data I must keep for administrative, legal, or security
                            purposes.</p>
                        <h3>Where I send your data</h3>
                        <p>I may check visitor comments through an automated spam detection service.</p>
